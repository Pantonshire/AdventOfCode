## Day 01
I wrote solutions in two different langauges today: Haskell and Go. The Haskell solution is mostly just an excuse to try out the things I
learned this week about monads, but I didn't spend much time trying to optimise it. On the other hand, I managed to get the Go solution to
be quite performant!
